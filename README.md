# Novel-Virus-Discovery-Pipeline

This is the archive of the project that I conducted from October 2017 to December 2017.  
The project was for developing the pipeline which can be used for discovering novel virus using a range of bioinformatics tools specifically by analyzing NGS data.  
This repository consists of pipeline script file and the presentation file that explains components of the pipeline.  
Actually, it is not well documented because this pipeline was used for internal users, especially me.  
If you have any questions, please contact me anytime.
